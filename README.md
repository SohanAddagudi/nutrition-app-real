# nutrition-app-real
Created a full stack web application using React and the Django rest API to provide authentication. This app allows users to input their daily caloric count as well as other macronutrients. The app also allows the user to directly search up foods through the 'Spoonacular' API which inputs calories and macronutrients more efficiently.
